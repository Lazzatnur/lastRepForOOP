### OOP Project for endterm
##### Game Tetris
> In Tetris, players must complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces (tetrominoes), which descend onto the playing field. 
> The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. 
> The game ends when the playing field is filled. 
> The longer the player can delay this inevitable outcome, the higher their score will be.
